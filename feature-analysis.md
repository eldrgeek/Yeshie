## Removal Plan

### Priority Order
1. Diagnostic Logging (if not needed in production)
2. Clipboard Operations (if not critical)
3. Complex Focus Management (if can be simplified)

### Dependencies to Handle
- Ensure core editor functionality remains intact
- Maintain message passing system
- Preserve session management
- Keep command execution system

### Testing Requirements
- Test editor functionality after each removal
- Verify message passing still works
- Check session management
- Validate command execution
- Test focus behavior

### Rollback Plan
- Keep removed code in version control
- Document removed features
- Create feature flags if needed
- Maintain separate branches for feature removal
