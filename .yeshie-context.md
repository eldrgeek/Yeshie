# Yeshie Project Context

## Project Overview
Yeshie is a browser extension that enables natural language interaction with LLMs through a collaboration interface. The core functionality includes:

1. Learning Mode: Ability to learn how to interact with different LLM interfaces
2. Pro Mode: Using an open LLM tab instead of direct API calls
3. Browser Automation: Using Stepper functions to control browser actions

## Current Implementation Status
- Phase 1: LLM Learning Implementation is in progress
- Currently working on Step 1: Command Parser Implementation
- Initial focus on ChatGPT integration

## Key Components

### Stepper Functionality
Documented in `stepper-documentation.md`, includes:
- Navigation commands
- Element interaction
- Page state monitoring
- Advanced operations

### Project Plan
Documented in `project-plan.md`, current focus:
1. Command parser for "Learn" commands
2. Toast notification system
3. Stepper integration
4. Selector discovery
5. Pattern storage and validation

## Technical Context
- Browser extension using Plasmo framework
- TypeScript implementation
- Chrome extension APIs
- Stepper for browser automation

## Development Workflow
1. Code changes
2. Extension reload
3. Automatic test command execution
4. Clipboard-based debugging output

## Next Steps
1. Implement command parser for "Learn" commands
2. Create toast notification system
3. Develop initial ChatGPT pattern
4. Implement debugging infrastructure

- `extension/contents/Yeshie.tsx`: Main extension content script
- `extension/functions/Stepper.ts`: Browser automation core
- `stepper-documentation.md`: Stepper functionality guide
- `project-plan.md`: Current project implementation plan

## Design Decisions
- Using toast notifications for user guidance
- Clipboard-based debugging output
- Initial ChatGPT pattern will be hardcoded
- Automatic test command execution after reload

## Current Challenges
- Console error sharing
- LLM interface pattern discovery
- User interaction recording
- Error recovery mechanisms
