# Using Cursor IDE with Yeshie

This guide explains how to set up the Cursor IDE as a standalone application and connect it to the Yeshie project. It also covers built‑in features like inline chat and automated pull‑request review.

## Obtain the Cursor IDE

1. Visit [https://www.cursor.sh/](https://www.cursor.sh/) and download the installer for your platform.
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install the application.
3. Launch **Cursor** from your applications menu or start menu.

## Open this Project in Cursor

1. In the Cursor window, choose **Clone Repository** from the welcome screen or **File → Clone Repository**.
2. Enter the repository URL for Yeshie or select a local path if you have already cloned it.
3. Cursor will open the project in a familiar VS Code‑style interface.

## Built‑in AI Features

Cursor includes several AI tools that can assist with development:

- **Inline Chat** – highlight code and press `Cmd/Ctrl+K` to ask questions or request edits directly within the editor.
- **Commit Message Generation** – when committing changes, Cursor can suggest commit messages.
- **Pull Request Review** – open a PR and use the "Review with AI" button to generate review comments.
- **Codebase Search** – natural‑language search across files with the shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl+L`.

These features can speed up code understanding and review tasks.

## Notes on Extensions

Cursor ships as a complete editor, so you do **not** need to install a separate VS Code extension. If you previously used the Cursor extension inside VS Code, you can uninstall it and run the standalone IDE instead.
