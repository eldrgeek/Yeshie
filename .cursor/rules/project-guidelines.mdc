# Yeshie Project Rules

## Context
Always include the contents of .yeshie-context.md in the initial context of new chats. This file contains the current project status, implementation details, and next steps.

## Guidelines
1. Always reference the project plan and current implementation status
2. Use Stepper functions as documented in stepper-documentation.md
3. Follow the development workflow:
   - Make code changes
   - Test with automatic command execution
   - Capture debugging output to clipboard
4. Maintain consistency with existing patterns and implementations
5. Document any new patterns or selectors discovered
6. Use toast notifications for user guidance
7. Implement error recovery mechanisms
8. Follow TypeScript best practices
9. Use Chrome extension APIs appropriately
10. Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
11. Adhere to and contribute to rules defined in `.cursor/rules` (e.g., `coding_standards.md`). Regularly review these rules to ensure consistency and learn project-specific best practices.
12, If I recoomend a change that violates any of the rules, let me know and determine
a. If that rule needs to be replaced with a new one
b. If this is a special case
c. If the rule should be modified to handle this case as well
## File Structure
- Keep implementation files in the extension/ directory
- Documentation in root directory
- Follow existing naming conventions

## Testing
- Always include test commands after implementation
- Capture console output for debugging
- Verify pattern storage and retrieval
- Test error recovery mechanisms

## Communication
- Be explicit about implementation details
- Document any assumptions
- Provide clear next steps
- Include relevant code snippets when discussing changes
