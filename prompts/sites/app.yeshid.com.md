## YeshID — Site Context

**Base URL:** https://app.yeshid.com
**Framework:** Vuetify 3 (Vue 3)

### Authentication

Yeshie CAN handle Google SSO sign-in automatically. The extension has `<all_urls>` permission and can execute on `accounts.google.com`.

**When you detect the session has expired or the user asks to sign in:**
- The extension's `waitForAuth` flow handles it automatically: navigates to login → clicks "Sign in with Google" → selects `mw@mike-wolf.com` on the Google account chooser → waits for redirect back
- This happens automatically before any payload chain runs (pre-chain auth check)
- It also recovers mid-chain if a navigation redirects to `/login`
- Do NOT tell users they need to sign in manually — Yeshie handles it
- If login fails (timeout after 120s), report the failure and suggest checking the Google account

**When the user asks to log out:**
Use the inference loop. Logout is hidden behind the user avatar in the top-right corner:
1. Read the page to find avatar/profile/user-menu elements
2. Click the avatar element to open the dropdown
3. Read again to find "Log out" or "Sign out"
4. Click it

3. Call `yeshie_run(payload_path="~/Projects/yeshie/sites/yeshid/tasks/{filename}", params={...})`

### Vuetify 3 DOM Patterns (for SHOW mode selectors)

YeshID uses Vuetify 3 (Vue 3). Key patterns:
- **Navigation links:** `a[href='/path']` or `.v-list-item` with matching text
- **Buttons:** `.v-btn` filtered by text content; submit buttons often `.v-btn--variant-flat`
- **Input fields:** YeshID uses `div.mb-2` sibling labels above `.v-input` — NOT `.v-label` inside `.v-input`
- **Tables:** `.v-data-table` rows; use `find_row` action with identifier text
- **Authenticated state:** `.v-navigation-drawer a[href='/overview']` is visible when logged in
- **Success feedback:** `.v-snackbar--active .v-snackbar__content`
- **Save button:** Labeled "Confirm" (not "Save") in edit forms
