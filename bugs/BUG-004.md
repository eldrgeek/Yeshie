# BUG-004: Tab Page showing repeated getLastTab messages in console

- **Status**: Open
- **Priority**: ðŸŸ¨ Medium
- **Component**: Tab Page (extension/tabs/index.tsx)
- **Added**: 2025-05-01
- **Fixed**: Not yet
- **Assigned To**: Unassigned

## Description
The Tab Page is showing repeated console messages related to fetching the last tab information. These messages appear to be triggered by the polling mechanism in the Tab Page component, but the frequency and verbosity of the logs is excessive and could impact performance.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the Yeshie extension
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Navigate to the Console tab
4. Observe repeated messages like:
   ```
   Fetching last tab info...
   Message received: {name: 'getLastTab'} from: {...}
   Retrieved last active tab (verified): {...}
   Got last tab info: {...}
   ```

## Expected Behavior
- The Tab Page should fetch the last tab information without excessive logging
- Console messages should be minimal and only show important state changes
- Polling should be efficient and not flood the console with repeated messages

## Technical Details
- The issue appears to be in the polling mechanism in `extension/tabs/index.tsx`
- Current polling interval is set to 5 seconds
- Messages are being logged at multiple levels:
  - Tab Page component
  - Message handling system
  - Background script
- The repeated messages suggest that the polling mechanism might be triggering more frequently than intended

## Potential Solutions
1. Reduce logging verbosity by:
   - Removing redundant console.log statements
   - Using a debug flag to control logging
   - Implementing a more sophisticated logging system
2. Optimize the polling mechanism:
   - Consider using a more efficient update strategy
   - Implement debouncing for the polling function
   - Use WebSocket or other real-time communication if available
3. Add a configuration option to control logging level in development mode
