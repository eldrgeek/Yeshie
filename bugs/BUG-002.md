## Description
The tab page shows a React warning about an undefined component when importing SpeechInput but not using it directly in the component tree.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the tab page in development mode
2. Check browser console
3. Observe warning: "Warning: React.jsx: type is invalid -- expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: %s.%s undefined"

## Expected Behavior
No warnings should appear in the console. Unused imports should not cause render errors.

## Technical Details
- The error appears on line 24 of index.tsx
- The SpeechInput component is imported but not used in the Tab page
- Error: "You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports."

## Potential Solutions
- Remove the unused import from the Tab page
- Fix the export in the SpeechEditor component
- Ensure proper named vs default export consistency

## Implementation Notes
The simplest solution is to remove the unused import in extension/tabs/index.tsx:

```typescript
// Remove this line:
import { SpeechInput } from "../components/SpeechEditor";
```

This was implemented and fixed in the previous pull request.
