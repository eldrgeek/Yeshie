# BUG-003: Extension tabs not updating last visited tab

- **Status**: Open
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Component**: Tab History System
- **Added**: 2025-05-01
- **Fixed**: Not yet
- **Assigned To**: Unassigned

## Description
When switching to Chrome extension-related tabs (like chrome://extensions or chrome://extensions-frame), the last visited tab is not being updated in the tab history system. This affects the ability to return to the previous tab when using the "Return to Tab" feature.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Visit any regular website (e.g., google.com)
2. Navigate to a Chrome extension page (e.g., chrome://extensions)
3. Open the Yeshie extension
4. The "Last Active Tab" should show the regular website, but it may not update correctly

## Expected Behavior
The tab history system should track and update the last visited tab regardless of whether it's a regular website or a Chrome extension page.

## Technical Details
- The issue likely occurs because Chrome extension pages have special URL schemes (chrome://, chrome-extension://)
- The current tab tracking system may be filtering out these URLs
- This affects the reliability of the "Return to Tab" feature

## Potential Solutions
1. Modify the tab tracking logic to include Chrome extension pages
2. Add special handling for chrome:// URLs in the tab history system
3. Implement a whitelist of allowed URL schemes instead of blacklisting
4. Add logging to track which URLs are being filtered out

## Implementation Notes
The fix will likely require changes to:
1. The tab history tracking system in `extension/background/tabHistory.ts`
2. URL validation logic to properly handle chrome:// URLs
3. Testing with various Chrome extension pages to ensure proper tracking
