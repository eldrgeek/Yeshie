# Remaining Tasks

The following features were requested but are not yet fully implemented:

- Cross-profile communication and organizing window lists by profile.
- Robust bug fixes and tests for the Speech Input component.
- Ensure the Speech Input is used for all user input and auto-focuses on the active tab/component.

Future work should address these items.
