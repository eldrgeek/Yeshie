# Yeshie Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy and priorities for the Yeshie Chrome extension. It serves as a roadmap for implementing comprehensive test coverage.

## Current Test Coverage
- Basic extension loading and visibility
- Simple interaction with editor on localhost
- Basic GitHub integration verification

## Priority Test Areas

### 1. Core Extension Functionality (High Priority)
- [ ] Extension popup behavior
  - Opening/closing
  - State persistence
  - UI element verification
- [ ] Editor functionality
  - Text input/output
  - Command history
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Auto-completion

### 2. Command Execution (High Priority)
- [ ] Basic navigation commands
  - `navto` with various URL formats
  - Navigation history
  - Error handling for invalid URLs
- [ ] File operations
  - Reading files
  - Creating files
  - Modifying files
  - Error handling for file operations
- [ ] Git operations
  - Repository status
  - Branch operations
  - Commit operations
  - Error handling for git commands

### 3. GitHub Integration (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Authentication
  - Login flow
  - Token management
  - Error handling
- [ ] Repository interactions
  - Repository listing
  - File browsing
  - Pull request interactions
  - Issue management

### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases (High Priority)
- [ ] Network failures
  - Timeout handling
  - Retry mechanisms
  - Error messages
- [ ] Invalid states
  - Missing permissions
  - Invalid configurations
  - Corrupted state
- [ ] Resource limitations
  - Large file handling
  - Memory constraints
  - Rate limiting

### 5. Cross-browser Compatibility (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Chrome-specific features
- [ ] Browser API compatibility
- [ ] Extension manifest variations

### 6. Performance Testing (Low Priority)
- [ ] Load time measurements
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Command execution timing
- [ ] Resource utilization

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
1. Expand current E2E test to cover basic editor operations
2. Add command execution tests for navigation
3. Implement error handling tests for common failures

### Phase 2: GitHub Integration
1. Add authentication flow tests
2. Implement repository operation tests
3. Add error handling for GitHub API interactions

### Phase 3: Edge Cases and Performance
1. Add tests for error conditions
2. Implement performance benchmarks
3. Add cross-browser compatibility tests

## Test Development Guidelines
1. Each test should be independent and self-contained
2. Use retry mechanisms for network-dependent operations
3. Clean up test data and state after each test
4. Document test prerequisites and assumptions
5. Include both positive and negative test cases

## Dependencies and Prerequisites
1. Local development server running
2. GitHub test account credentials
3. Test repository access
4. Chrome browser installed
5. Python test environment configured
