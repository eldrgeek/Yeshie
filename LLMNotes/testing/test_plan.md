# Yeshie Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy and priorities for the Yeshie Chrome extension. It serves as a roadmap for implementing comprehensive test coverage.

## Current Test Coverage
- Basic extension loading and visibility
- Simple interaction with editor on localhost
- Basic GitHub integration verification

## Priority Test Areas

### 1. GitHub Login Flow Recording (Highest Priority)
- [ ] GitHub Navigation and Login Recording
  - Direct navigation using Yeshie's `navto` command
  - User prompt system for login guidance
  - Action recording during manual login
  - Recipe creation from recorded actions
  - Verification of recorded steps
  - Logout and replay testing

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Navigate to GitHub
   - Use Yeshie's `navto` command
   - Verify successful navigation

2. User Interaction Recording
   - Implement user prompt system
   - Display "Log in to Github while I watch" message
   - Monitor and record user actions:
     - Click events
     - Input field interactions
     - Form submissions

3. Action Recording to Recipe
   - Convert user actions to Stepper commands
   - Display recorded steps in Collaboration pane
   - Allow user to signal completion
   - Save recorded steps as recipe

4. Verification and Testing
   - Request user logout
   - Save complete login flow as recipe
   - Replay recorded steps
   - Verify successful automated login

### 2. Core Extension Functionality (High Priority)
- [ ] Extension popup behavior
  - Opening/closing
  - State persistence
  - UI element verification
- [ ] Editor functionality
  - Text input/output from testing framework
  - Submitting test requests

### 3. Command Execution (High Priority)
- [ ] Basic navigation commands
  - `navto` with various URL formats
  - Stepper functions for GitHub flow
  - Error handling for invalid URLs
- [ ] User interaction commands
  - Message display
  - Action recording
  - Recipe management

### 4. GitHub Integration (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Authentication
  - Login flow
  - Error handling
- [ ] Repository interactions
  - Repository listing
  - File browsing
  - Pull request interactions
  - Issue management

### 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases (High Priority)
- [ ] Network failures
  - Timeout handling
  - Retry mechanisms
  - Error messages
- [ ] Invalid states
  - Missing permissions
  - Invalid configurations
  - Corrupted state
- [ ] Resource limitations
  - Large file handling
  - Memory constraints
  - Rate limiting

### 6. Cross-browser Compatibility (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Chrome-specific features
- [ ] Browser API compatibility
- [ ] Extension manifest variations

### 7. Performance Testing (Low Priority)
- [ ] Load time measurements
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Command execution timing
- [ ] Resource utilization

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Learning 
1. Expand current E2E test to cover basic editor operations
2. Add command execution tests for navigation, click, set focus
3. Implement error handling tests for common failures

### Phase 2: GitHub Integration
Goal: navigate to a github page (login if not logged in) add user to github account
1. Add authentication flow tests
2. Implement repository operation tests
3. Add error handling for GitHub API interactions

### Phase 3: Edge Cases and Performance
1. Add tests for error conditions
2. Implement performance benchmarks
3. Add cross-browser compatibility tests

## Test Development Guidelines
1. Each test should be independent and self-contained
2. Use retry mechanisms for network-dependent operations
3. Clean up test data and state after each test
4. Document test prerequisites and assumptions
5. Include both positive and negative test cases

## Dependencies and Prerequisites
1. Local development server running
2. GitHub test account credentials
3. Test repository access
4. Chrome browser installed
5. Python test environment configured

## Limitations
- Playwright and pytest must be installed before running the new Stepper command tests.
- This environment does not allow network access after setup, so dependencies must be preinstalled or provided via a setup script.
