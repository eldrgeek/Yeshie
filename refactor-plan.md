- [x] **1. Standardize and Centralize Storage Management**

  Consolidate all Chrome extension storage interactions into a single utility module (e.g., `storage.ts`).

  Ensure consistent use of asynchronous patterns (async/await) for all storage operations.

- [x] **2. Extract Reusable Components**

  Identify repeated UI patterns (e.g., buttons, inputs, toasts, modals) and abstract them into a reusable component library (e.g., `components/ui`).

  Replace direct DOM manipulations with React-managed state and components wherever possible.

- [x] **3. Implement Comprehensive TypeScript Types**

  Audit and enhance existing TypeScript interfaces and types for clarity and consistency.

  Ensure each functional module (e.g., messaging, background tasks, UI interactions) has explicit, well-defined types.

- [ ] **4. Improve Error Handling and Logging**

  Introduce a unified error handling strategy across background and content scripts.

  Implement structured logging (e.g., `logger.ts`) to capture meaningful debug and error information clearly and consistently.

- [ ] **5. Refactor Messaging System**

  Standardize message formats and handlers across the extension using clearly defined types and interfaces.

  Abstract messaging logic into a central module (`messaging.ts`) to simplify and clarify interactions.

- [ ] **6. Clean Up CSS Management**

  Utilize CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS consistently to maintain styling modularity and avoid global style leaks.

- [ ] **7. Enhance State Management**

  Consider integrating a lightweight state management library such as Zustand or Redux Toolkit for predictable UI state management.

- [ ] **8. Optimize Tab Management**

  Refactor tab handling logic to a central module (`tabs.ts`) ensuring consistent methods for opening, focusing, and managing tabs.

- [ ] **9. Testing and CI/CD Integration**

  Add initial Jest and Playwright tests for critical flows to ensure reliability and easier refactoring.

  Set up a basic continuous integration pipeline to automate linting, formatting, type checks, and tests.

- [ ] **10. Documentation and Comments**

  Ensure each significant function and module has clear JSDoc comments explaining intent, usage, and edge cases.

  Maintain a comprehensive README outlining setup, usage, and development guidelines clearly and succinctly.
