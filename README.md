## System Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- Google Chrome browser
- npm or yarn package manager
- pnpm package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eldrgeek/Yeshie.git
   cd Yeshie
   ```

2. Add the `scripts` directory to your PATH:
   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/scripts
   ```

3. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   install
   ```

4. Update the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file with your actual API key.

5. Set up the Chrome extension:
   - Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension` folder from the project

## Configuration

The installation script creates a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PORT=3001
```

## Running the System

To run the entire system, use the following command from the root directory:
```bash
dev dev
```

This command will start the following components:
- Node.js server
- React client
- Python monitor
- Chrome extension in development mode

## Using the System

1. **Chrome Extension**:
   - Click on the Yeshie AI icon in your Chrome browser to open the sidebar
   - Use the sidebar to interact with the AI assistant and perform tasks

2. **Web Client**:
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
   - Use the web interface for collaborative editing and AI-assisted tasks

3. **Collaboration**:
   - Share the same session ID with other users to collaborate in real-time
   - Use the "Rewind" feature to review and analyze previous actions

4. **AI Commands**:
   - Type AI commands in the sidebar or web client to perform automated tasks
   - Use natural language to describe the task you want to accomplish

5. **Browser Automation**:
   - Use specific commands to automate browser actions (e.g., navigation, clicking, typing)

## Development

- Server code is located in the `src` directory
- Client code is in the `client` directory
- Chrome extension code is in the `extension` directory

To run individual components:

- Server: `npm run dev:server`
- Client: `npm run dev:client`
- Monitor: `npm run dev:monitor`
- Extension: `npm run dev:extension`

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter connection issues, ensure all components are running and check the console for error messages
- For extension issues, check the Chrome extension page for any error logs
- If AI features are not working, verify your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file

For more detailed troubleshooting, check the logs in the `out` file generated by the system.

## Deployment on Replit

To deploy the server and web pages (excluding Python components) on Replit:

1. Create a new Repl on Replit and select "Node.js" as the language.
2. Upload the server and client code to the Repl.
3. In the Repl's shell, run the following commands:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
   ```
4. Create a new file named `.replit` in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   run = "npm start"
   ```
5. Click the "Run" button to start the server.

Note: Make sure to set up environment variables in the Replit secrets for sensitive information like API keys.

## Packaging Components

### Packaging the Python Monitor

To package the Python monitor and its dependencies as a single file:

1. Install PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
2. Run PyInstaller to create a single executable:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile monitor.py
   ```
3. The packaged executable will be available in the `dist` directory.

### Packaging the Chrome Extension

To package the Chrome extension for distribution:

1. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Ensure "Developer mode" is enabled.
3. Click "Pack extension"
4. Select the `extension` directory as the "Extension root directory"
5. Click "Pack Extension"
6. Chrome will create two files: a `.crx` file (the packaged extension) and a `.pem` file (the private key)

### Download Page

Add the following route to your server to serve a download page for the extension and Python monitor:

```javascript
app.get('/download', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`
    <html>
      <head><title>Yeshie AI Downloads</title></head>
      <body>
        <h1>Yeshie AI Downloads</h1>
        <h2>Chrome Extension</h2>
        <p>Download and install the Yeshie AI Chrome extension:</p>
        <a href="/download/extension.crx">Download Extension</a>
        <h2>Python Monitor</h2>
        <p>Download and run the Yeshie AI Python monitor:</p>
        <a href="/download/monitor.exe">Download Monitor</a>
        <h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>For the Chrome extension:
            <ul>
              <li>Download the .crx file</li>
              <li>Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/</li>
              <li>Drag and drop the .crx file into the Chrome window</li>
              <li>Click "Add extension" when prompted</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>For the Python monitor:
            <ul>
              <li>Download the .exe file</li>
              <li>Run the executable to start the monitor</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </body>
    </html>
  `);
});
```

Ensure to place the packaged extension and monitor in the appropriate directories for the server to serve them.

## Utilities

The `scripts` directory contains various utility scripts to help with development and maintenance:

### killports.sh

A utility script to free up commonly used ports (3000 and 3001) that might be stuck in use.

Usage:
```bash
# Make the script executable (first time only)
chmod +x scripts/killports.sh

# Run the script
./scripts/killports.sh
```

Features:
- Automatically checks ports 3000 (client) and 3001 (server)
- Identifies processes using these ports
- Safely terminates any processes found
- Verifies ports are free after termination
- Provides detailed feedback about actions taken

Example output:
```bash
Checking port 3000...
Found process 1234 using port 3000
Killing process...
Successfully killed process 1234

Checking port 3001...
No process found using port 3001

Verifying ports are free...
Port 3000 is free
Port 3001 is free
```

### dev.ts

A TypeScript-based development environment manager that:
- Automatically detects file dependencies
- Watches for changes in both main files and their imports
- Supports both TypeScript and Python files
- Manages different development profiles
- Provides concurrent execution of multiple services

Usage:
```bash
# Run the default development profile
dev

# Run a specific profile
dev dev        # Development profile
dev codeStore  # CodeStore profile
dev llm        # LLM profile

# Run a specific file
dev monitor    # Run monitor.py with auto-reload
```
