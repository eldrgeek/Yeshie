# Autoloop Command: `autoloop-run`

Use the local `autoloop` CLI as the source of truth for this workflow action.

These installed names are agent wrappers, not native `autoloop` CLI subcommands. A wrapper may call multiple `autoloop` commands and edit normal project files under the hood.

## Required action

1. Work from the current workspace root.
2. Use `autoloop` commands, preferring `--json` when structured output is needed.
3. Return important CLI output faithfully.
4. Do not manually edit `.autoloop/state.json`, `.autoloop/last_eval.json`, or `.autoloop/experiments.jsonl`.
5. If the `autoloop` executable is unavailable, stop and tell the user to install or build it.

## Shared contract reference

# Shared Action: `autoloop-run`

Run an autonomous autoloop session for a bounded number of experiments with minimal user interaction.

## Inputs

- User goal or optimization target
- Current workspace root
- Existing `.autoloop/` state, if present
- Optional experiment or time bounds from the user

## Behavior

1. Treat this action as permission to run the full loop without asking for confirmation between setup steps or experiments.
2. Determine the run bound:
   - use the user-specified experiment limit when present
   - otherwise use the user-specified time limit when present
   - otherwise default to 5 experiments
3. Ensure autoloop is initialized. If not, run `autoloop init --verify`.
4. Before baseline or iteration, run `autoloop doctor --json`.
5. If doctor reports an unhealthy config and a verified repair is available, run `autoloop doctor --fix --json`, then recheck health.
6. If the config is still unhealthy after repair, stop and ask one short blocking question instead of forcing the loop forward.
7. Ensure a baseline exists. If not, perform the `autoloop-baseline` behavior first.
8. Inspect `git status --short` before starting the loop.
9. If the repo is dirty only because of setup artifacts created by AutoLoop integration or initialization, treat that state as pre-existing setup rather than as an experiment:
   - examples: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.opencode/`, `.gemini/`, or a `.gitignore` entry for `.autoloop/`
   - in throwaway or fixture repos, it is acceptable to commit those setup-only files before the session so the loop starts clean
   - otherwise leave them alone and rely on `autoloop pre` to snapshot experiment changes relative to the current state
10. Clean obvious generated cache noise before interpreting dirty state:
   - examples: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.pytest_cache/`, or other transient runtime caches
   - do not treat generated caches as experiments
11. If other unrelated dirty files already exist, leave them untouched and do not sweep them into experiment descriptions, keep commits, or discard reverts.
12. Start a session if none is active.
13. If an unresolved pending eval already exists, resolve it before starting a new experiment:
   - keep it with `autoloop keep --description "..." --commit` when the recorded verdict and worktree state support keeping it
   - otherwise discard it with `autoloop discard --description "..." --reason "..." --revert`
14. Read `.autoloop/learnings.md` when it exists.
15. Read `autoloop status --json --all` to understand the current history.
16. Run a bounded optimization loop:
   - propose one small, concrete experiment aligned with the user goal
   - run `autoloop pre --json --description "..."` before making the change
   - if history strongly suggests avoiding the idea, pick a different experiment instead of forcing it
   - make one focused, attributable change
   - run `autoloop eval --json`
   - never leave a pending eval unresolved: immediately keep with `--commit` or discard with `--revert`
   - periodically refresh `autoloop learn --json --session`
17. Stop when any stop condition is reached:
   - the experiment limit is reached
   - the time limit is reached
   - repeated blocked or crashed experiments suggest the loop is not progressing
   - no credible next experiments remain
18. Always end the session with `autoloop session end`.
19. Always run `autoloop learn --json --session` before finishing so `.autoloop/learnings.md` is refreshed by the CLI.
20. Return a concise summary of what was tried, what improved, and what branches or follow-up actions are recommended.

## Rules

- Prefer `--json` for decision-making.
- Keep each experiment small and attributable.
- Default to at most 5 experiments when the user does not specify a bound.
- Treat healthy doctor output as a prerequisite for baseline and autonomous looping.
- Use `autoloop keep --commit` for wins and `autoloop discard --revert` for losses whenever the workspace state allows it.
- Do not edit `.git/info/exclude` or global git ignore files just to hide AutoLoop wrapper files from experiments.
- Treat setup-only dirt separately from experiment dirt; do not let wrapper installation become the first experiment.
- Do not ask the user between experiments unless blocked by missing information, unsafe ambiguity, or repeated hard failures.
- Do not manually edit `.autoloop/state.json`, `.autoloop/last_eval.json`, or `.autoloop/experiments.jsonl`.
- Bound the run. Never interpret this action as permission to loop forever unless the user explicitly requests that.
