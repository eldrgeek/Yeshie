# E2E Extension Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document tracks our testing strategy for fixing the Yeshie Chrome extension speech recognition bugs, specifically the issue where speech recognition doesn't restart after navigating away and back to a page.

## Core Problem
The main bug: When navigating away from a page and back, speech recognition components don't restart automatically, requiring manual clicking of speech buttons and text areas to re-enable transcription.

## Root Cause Analysis ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Issue Identified**: Navigation causes speech editor components to unmount/remount, but initialization logic wasn't properly restarting listening
- **Technical Cause**: `window.speechGlobalState` functions were not being injected into page context, preventing communication between page-level components and extension background

## Architecture Changes Made ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 1. Global State Management System
- **File**: `extension/functions/speechGlobalState.ts` ‚úÖ EXISTS
- **Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Functions**: All 8 core functions implemented (get/set state, register/unregister editors, focus management, etc.)

### 2. Background Script Integration  
- **File**: `extension/background/index.ts` ‚úÖ UPDATED
- **Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED  
- **Changes**: Global state initialization, function exposure for debugging

### 3. Content Script Injection System
- **File**: `extension/contents/speechGlobalStateInjector.tsx` ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Purpose**: Injects `window.speechGlobalState` functions into page context
- **Method**: Uses script injection + proxy pattern for communication

### 4. Plasmo Message Handlers
- **Directory**: `extension/background/messages/` ‚úÖ CREATED
- **Status**: ‚úÖ ALL 8 HANDLERS IMPLEMENTED
- **Files Created**:
  - `getSpeechGlobalState.ts` ‚úÖ
  - `setSpeechGlobalState.ts` ‚úÖ
  - `registerSpeechEditor.ts` ‚úÖ
  - `unregisterSpeechEditor.ts` ‚úÖ
  - `getActiveSpeechEditors.ts` ‚úÖ
  - `setSpeechEditorFocus.ts` ‚úÖ
  - `getFocusedSpeechEditor.ts` ‚úÖ
  - `handleSpeechRecognitionEnd.ts` ‚úÖ

### 5. SpeechEditor Component Updates
- **File**: `extension/content/SpeechEditor.tsx` ‚úÖ PREVIOUSLY UPDATED
- **Status**: ‚úÖ EXTENSIVELY REFACTORED
- **Features**: Enhanced restart logic, page visibility handling, auto-restart monitoring

## Testing Infrastructure

### Testing Environment Setup
- **Chrome Debugging**: Uses port 9222 for CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol)
- **Script Location**: `tests/cdp/`
- **Restart Script**: `restart-chrome-with-debugging.sh` ‚úÖ EXISTS

### User Login Workflow Testing ‚úÖ NEW CAPABILITY

#### Purpose & Scope
A comprehensive testing workflow that demonstrates the complete lifecycle of:
1. Opening Chrome with the extension loaded
2. Testing core extension functionality with CDP
3. Verifying extension logs and activity monitoring
4. Ensuring Chrome debugging setup works correctly

#### Implementation Details
- **Files**: Core CDP test suite in `tests/cdp/src/tests/`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ STREAMLINED AND FUNCTIONAL
- **Dependencies**: CDP infrastructure, Chrome debugging setup

#### Available Core Tests

**CDP Connection Test** ‚úÖ
- Tests basic Chrome DevTools Protocol connection
- Verifies debugging port accessibility
- Lists available targets (tabs, service workers)

**Extension Verification** ‚úÖ  
- Checks for extension service worker targets
- Validates extension background script is loaded
- Confirms extension is ready for operation

**Log Testing Workflow** ‚úÖ
- Tests log clearing functionality
- Records extension actions and activity
- Retrieves and analyzes log data
- Monitors console output for debugging

**Log Analysis** ‚úÖ
- Analyzes current extension logs
- Shows recent activity and events
- Helps debug extension behavior

#### Usage Examples

**Run All Core Tests**:
```bash
cd tests/cdp
npm run test:all
```

**Run Individual Tests**:
```bash
npm run test:cdp        # CDP connection
npm run test:extension  # Extension verification  
npm run test:logs       # Log testing workflow
```

**Expected Output**:
```
üß™ Running all CDP tests...

‚úÖ Log workflow test completed

üìä Test Summary:
‚úÖ Passed: 3
‚ùå Failed: 0
üìã Total: 3
```

#### Technical Implementation Features

**Automated Testing** ‚úÖ
```typescript
// Basic CDP connection testing
const client = await CDP({ host: 'localhost', port: 9222 });
const targets = await Target.getTargets();
console.log(`Found ${targets.length} targets`);
```

**Extension State Verification** ‚úÖ
```typescript
// Service worker detection
const serviceWorkers = targets.filter(t => t.type === 'service_worker');
const yeshieExtension = serviceWorkers.find(sw => 
    sw.url.includes('chrome-extension://') && sw.url.includes('background')
);
```

**Log Monitoring** ‚úÖ  
```typescript
// Console log capture and analysis
await Runtime.enable();
Runtime.consoleAPICalled((params) => {
    console.log(`Console: ${params.type}: ${params.args.map(a => a.value).join(' ')}`);
});
```
